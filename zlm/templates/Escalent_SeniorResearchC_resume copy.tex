                {Machine Learning Engineer}{May 2024 - Present}
                                    {\normalfont{\textit{PwC India (Third Party Hiring by FirstMeridian Private Limited)}}}
                                {\normalfont{\textit{Kolkata}}}
                                    \item Developed a RAG Chatbot for a healthcare client, implementing advanced RAG techniques to handle complex scenarios like tables, diagrams, and flowcharts, improving client query resolution time by 25\%.
                                    \item Built a table comparison tool using Python and ML for PwC's healthcare client, implementing similarity techniques, hypothesis testing, regular expressions, and BERT models to match columns based on names and values, resulting in a 15\% increase in data analysis efficiency.
                                    \item Developed solutions for vehicular perception using inertial sensor signals, classifying transient and persistent events (potholes, cracks, speed bumps, surface type, etc.) using Random Forest, achieving an 89\% F1 score after addressing data imbalance with SMOTE and incorporating GitHub Actions for CI/CD, improving the accuracy of data analysis by 10\%.
                            \end{rSubsection}
                    \begin{rSubsection}
                {Machine Learning Engineer}{October 2023 - May 2024}
                                    {\normalfont{\textit{Sunix AI}}}
                                {\normalfont{\textit{None}}}
                                    \item Developed a proof{-}of{-}concept object detection and tracking system for a sports client using YOLOv8 and OpenCV, achieving 75\% MAPE by tracking players with the football and detecting events (shot, dribbling, pass, tackle), providing the client with a more comprehensive understanding of game events.
                                    \item Improved annotation efficiency for the sports client by optimizing the annotation process and improving the accuracy of the object detection and tracking system, resulting in a 20\% reduction in annotation time.
                                    \item Preprocessed images to make object detection more accurate and efficient, leading to improved system performance and annotation speed, increasing overall productivity by 15\%.

                    \begin{rSubsection}
                {ML Engineer}{January 2023 - September 2023}
                                    {\normalfont{\textit{Rapyder Cloud Solutions}}}
                                {\normalfont{\textit{None}}}
                                    \item Developed an end{-}to{-}end healthcare analytics MLOPS pipeline using AWS Sagemaker and Snowflake, enabling real{-}time predictions and implementing CI/CD for model retraining, improving prediction accuracy by 10\% and reducing deployment time by 50\%.
                                    \item Built an end{-}to{-}end automated object detection workflow using AWS Sagemaker's built{-}in Resnet object detector, leveraging CI/CD services like CodeBuild, CodePipeline, and CodeDeploy, automating a previously manual process and saving an estimated 20 hours per week.
                                    \item Deployed a machine learning solution on AWS Fargate to achieve serverless deployment with a load balancer, improving scalability and reducing infrastructure management overhead, resulting in a 30\% reduction in infrastructure costs.
